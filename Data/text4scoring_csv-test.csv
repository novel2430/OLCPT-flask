1," No. These things, of course, are very difficult to predict specifically but I would say it's a reasonable thing to be in that situation within two to three years. Right. You know, it's very very difficult to but -- I would -- it's not -- let me put a little bit differently. It's not going to happen within two years, but and it will if we haven't done it within four or five years then we clearly have failed. And now what we're talking about are not when will our first product enter clinical. You asked me not when we first get products into human clinical trials. You asked me when do I believe that we will be in a position where on an ongoing basis of at least two? And on that and now I think it's probably more towards the end of that timeframe which I consider the intermediate term. Sooner, you are still talking about not -- I don't want to give anyone the impression that we expect to get stuff into human clinical trials in the next year and possibly not in the next two years. But it really depends on how the preclinical work goes. Well we're still in -- I mean we're in the early stages. As you know we just discovered these protein therapeutics and we are beginning to go through the initial steps in evaluating them. No. No. Oh no, I didn't notice that. We have, I know it is difficult for shareholders who have very short-term objectives, but we are attempting to build a substantial company that is going to have a major impact on the Pharma diagnostic world. We are doing it in a very different way by approaching it through predictive models. These are the kinds of things that, when you do things experimentally you can get lucky, find somethings quickly. When you do things predictably, unfortunately, you can't -- it's unlikely for you to get lucky. You have to gain the understanding, build the predictive models and that's why I attempted in my talk to what I would like our shareholders to understand is that we have now reached a very important point for the Company where we have -- clearly have the critical mass of -- in terms of this predictive capability that is represented in our people and the technologies we've developed and the discovery engines. We have a critical mass which can now begin to produce just on a routine predictable basis the types of discoveries that the entire industries are looking for. Now to turn discoveries into products and profits, whatever, is a long-term situation in our industry. And we understood this when we began to go down this road. Clearly the Company will -- the success of our Company, I believe, will be recognized by the financial community much before we have earnings, substantial earnings. Because I think that now with the type of discovery capability that we have, we have incredible opportunities for collaboration with the types of agreements that would be difficult for other organizations to enter into. Because, again, because they are built on predictable capabilities and not based on experimental work. So to the degree that -- I know it's frustrating but, unfortunately, it takes a long time to establish something of real value. I've been there before; and I've watched how it takes to develop companies. I'm very pleased with respect to the developments in this Company to date. I'm a very happy shareholder in this Company and I'm very optimistic about the future. But the type of work that we're doing just takes time. Geoffrey, we are going to need to have other people --  we will be able to capture a lot of our value in the discoveries by very in their life; so that we don't have to go ahead and develop tons and tons of them that people will recognize as the kind of things we discovered inherently have higher probabilities of success, because they come from the predictive capability. And that we will be able to make"
2," In our initial run we did identify a number of, actually, I don't remember the exact number that we decided to focus on and we now are evaluating some of the remaining from this initial chosen list for validation and there will be others put into validation now. Yes, I think there is clearly interest by the major pharmaceutical companies in Compugen. I would take the position, at this point in time it seems like a large part of the interest relates to the very unusual capability that we have created here. In many cases the specific product opportunities that are in our pipeline now are still at a point where they're, in general, earlier than big pharmaceutical companies are used to licensing them in. But we are in discussions with a number of them now. Well, again, when you're predicting when you might see an agreement is an impossible task, but you are correct that in the diagnostic area the movement can be much quicker to commercialization. And we do have platforms here that can create many interesting targets for diagnostics, which we have been doing and have been doing some validation on our own. You're typically very limited and we have been giving, showing these to our client companies. The only thing I can say is that, as developments happen, when it's appropriate and when it's for competitive reasons we can do it, we will make announcements. No. I'm not happy. I think it's been much slower than I had hoped it would be. That's a possibility eed. And we're in the final stages now of entering into an arrangement with a very well-known international organization that focuses solely life science, IR and has done a marvelous job for many other companies. And this, I mean, this week, next week, could be signed and I think it's fair to say they're very enthusiastic about beginning to get this story out. They recognize fully the unusual nature of what we have created here and the potential for really making a change in the pharma world. We actually have discussed at the Board level the idea of poison pills and whatever, but in the end decided that there's always a question as to what's right for the Company versus the shareholders and management. To date we've decided not to have any of the sort of unusual types of poison pills. Yes. Also, one of the things I think we should be careful about is focusing too much on any sort of one product, not from the standpoint that each individual product isn't potentially valuable or whatever. The unique thing about our Company is the diversity and the number of opportunities that we are going after. I mention this, maybe it's just because of my history. I remember, in my prior life, dealing with a company that was working on many different projects and you never know which ones are going to be successful, which ones are not going to be successful. The key to build a profitable, low-risk pharma company is getting enough bets on the table, because you know a lot of them are going to fail. It's just the name of the game. Hopefully, given the way we do predictive biology, that over time the failures -- the percentage of successes with product candidates coming from Compugen will just continue to get better and better. But they'll just have higher and higher probabilities of success just because of the nature of our research. But for many, many years the strength of the Company is going to be the number of products under development, rather than any particular single opportunity. Absolutely. But keep in mind that this is -- we've been doing this sort of field after field, platform after platform, have been validating the platforms, validating the initial products that have been produced by these or predicted and then experimentally validated. So, I mean, this is our Company and it's truly unique in our industry. Well, first of all let me say that we are aware of and familiar with this organization. As of now, what they are looking for, they're looking for technologies essentially to sponsor, so as far as I know, they're not looking to internally development stuff. And let me just say it's obvious that it's an organization that we will meet with and talk with. We have not yet, but it's obvious that it's one that we would look at. No, it was just the opposite for me when I saw that. I mean, our problem, our key problem with big pharma has been one that they have been so concerned about their short-term pipelines that they haven't been willing to look longer-term and just say, &quot;Look, this is a structural problem we have and the idea of licensing in a couple of extra Phase II drugs isn't going to solve the long-term problem of productivity. We've got to do something about it&quot;. So just about all of the big pharmas are really shaking the tree. They're hiring people sort of in parallel to their traditional R&D organization to evaluate new approaches. They're doing things like this. This can only help us. Our biggest problem has been lack of willingness of the pharma industry to look long-term and to get involved with things at an early stage because of the short-term issues. Actually, let me just thank everybody for participating and I know we have some long-term shareholders on the line. Once again, every time I get a chance, even though it's redundant, over and over again I really need to thank you for hanging in there as we create and as we have created the basis for what I am confident is going to be an extremely successful company. From the comments that Alex made with respect to some of the more recent validation and diversity of discoveries and platforms that we're now showing, I think it's becoming obvious that there's something very unusual, very unique and very powerful going on in this tiny little company. And I think we will, very shortly, be seeing it's impact on the world stage of pharmaceuticals, so thank you for hanging in there with us."
3," Thank you, Debbie. Can everybody hear me? Is it down on the speakers? Great. Fantastic. I'd like to welcome you to APC today. And certainly thank you for taking your time. It is really our sincere interest that we are able to answer most, of not all of your questions. Any questions we can't answer we'll be happy to get back with you on. And before we get going, I would like to see a show of hands just so I understand the mixture of the group here. How many Yankee fans do we have here? Not many Yankee fans. So we're in pretty good shape. Let's see. Just to start out, let's talk about what APC is all about. Very, very high level of attraction. Everybody's mission inside the company is to really create delighted customers. And we really take that seriously. It pervades everything we do. Everybody's quarterly bonus is attached to customer satisfaction, customer loyalty metrics. And it's really a fundamental way that we see of differentiating our business from our competition. In addition, I'd like to call your attention to market positioning -- Global, end to end, non stop networking. As you all might expect, although the actual components of the network are going down in cost, the value, the business value of the network continues to increase. So that's really where APC plays. It's really in all of the infrastructure except the IT elements of the customers' network, end to end. So we made sure that we built up our capability from the desktop to the distributed servers to the network closets and now to the full-blown tier 4 corporate data centers. Quick little piece of history. The company was founded in 1981. Three engineers from MIT and Lincoln labs. One comment about the history of the company. All three of the founders are still actively in the business. So it's really been a pretty stable environment for the business. One of the key milestones in 1994, we established our first international operation in Galway, Ireland. And the net result of that international focus has been a much stronger global footprint than any of our competitors. For example it's not unusual for any of our competitors to have a completely different product lines in Europe than in the U.S., meaning that they have to support both the engineering of those product lines, different engineering groups. But worse, from a customer point of view, things are complex. You cannot do a global rollout and use the same skews. You must map them to different solutions. Human error. Human error. Worth anywhere from 40% to 60% of the root cause of downtime in data centers today, 40% to 60%? Human errors. Well, if there is anything that cries out for standardization right, because if you have people operating the data center that move from one data center in the same company to a another data center, then everything is different. All the parts are different; all the control systems are different. It's the level of complexity you cannot expect humans to get defects out of. So, the andardize, standardize, standardize. The net result of going through both the IT recession that we saw, the ;Rodger, it's only a matter of time before you guys are the leading company in this space. You're investing so much more that anybody else in innovating the space. It hasn't been innovated in a long time. You are coming up with some great solutions that really address real problems.&quot; And therefore he said, &quot;We are going to start doing projects with you.&quot; Now these consulting engineers have a lot of say about taking new approaches to their customers. In addition we are working with as you'll hear more from Ed Bednarcik later, we are working with our own sales force talking to the larger end users. So that combination of push and pull is really beginning to work well. So we are in the first inning or two of the ISX game. We are still very, very raw. We introduced the whole ISX -- PowerStruXure was the initial version of it but we introduced the whole ISX about a year and a half, two years ago. And we are on this mission to really change the way the world designs and builds and operates data centers. What we are not trying to do -- we understand that our goal is ultimately long-term shareholder value. But the way to get there is to not try to take a new opportunity like this and try to squeeze it to optimize profitability short term. That will be a big mistake. The long-term opportunity is to really go for a larger share position in the new category, in the data center category. And then as we really drive the volume up, bring the cost down and optimize the profitability. What we are finding is our main angle of attack on the market is ISX. It's got a very strong value proposition. When was the last time somebody came and sold you something or offered you something that saved you 20% of your capital, 30% of your capital, 20% of your operating cost? Really big value proposition, very unusual. Huge value proposition. But that then there is because we are solving a more complex problem for the customer and because the customer wants fewer and fewer vendors. They really want fewer and fewer vendors. Because of that we are able to discover and address new opportunities for the small systems business. So you can continue to expect as we have seen today, slowly but surely our small system share is continuing to grow even though most all of our go to market focus is on ISX. Likewise, in the -- even in the silicon three base box business our volumes are growing. So although we are putting almost all the wind behind the ISX arrow, because of it's allowing us to open up new doors to customers that before wouldn't, take the time to talk to the UPS vendor, because they are much more strategic in their decision making. Now they can partner with three people basically. Not the application software. But they can partner with the server guy, the networking guy and we can take care of everything else. Which simplifies their life a lot. So ultimately we continue to see the opportunity to grow share in all categories pretty much. We don't see any major catalyst to just drive the needle off the chart. But we continue to be able to trend it up. We are going to be very flexible there depending upon customers requirements. And the customers are really going to tell us when and what to do with silicon. We need a continuous stream of engines for, for these data centers. And it's not unusual that customers even today will buy our, a few 480AT our KVA silicons for their data center application. It's really -- but they may like the rack but they may not want to go to o see a very tight coupling between power, MIPS and cooling -- very, very tightly coupled versus historically they didn't disconnect it because you can just flood the data center with cool air and you are all set. But now they are going to be very, very tighter coupled. So some major changes in how data center are going to be operating. The answer is that ISX applies to both situations. But right now if you look at the revenue that is occurring today, the majority is coming from"
4," The pieces are pretty actively moving around, and it depends, for example, if you look at InfraStrucXure Type A, B and C, the small medium and big. The small units, the Type As, they are a smaller piece of the business, but they are faster growing. So they are really gaining share and gaining momentum strongly. In addition, cooling is coming on very nicely, starting from a very small base. And additional new products that we have introduced that are very small additions to ISX are also gaining momentum. Yes. To the point of these are not on the demand side of the business, these are on the supply side of the business. Well, we know that the fundamental margins inside ISX, which is the real driver in Large Systems, are staying pretty healthy and are not too far off the Small Systems business. So we're talking about high 30s, low 40s for the gross margins as we continue to escalate the ISX business in terms of its percentage of the Large Systems business. The transitions for the most part, a very large number of transitions took place in Q2 and Q3 with the majority during the Q3 period, and they include not only shifting products out of existing production lines in the U.S. or in Western Europe, but also some expense associated with converting some of the production capacity inside the U.S. and Europe into solutions capability, where we are able to do the systems integration work and deliver the solution then to the customer. So all in all I would have to say that there are a lot of moving parts, but we do see a lot of ability to get more cost out, especially as we come down the learning curve on the production of some of these new products, as well as get the supply chain evened out due to all of the changes that we have cranked in. All of those. Yes. For example, some of the more mature low-end products that are pretty simple to build, we have moved a lot of those out of our production facilities into contract manufacturing, and we are really using our folks and our investments to do much more of the complex stuff that we are introducing. That is our general feeling, yes. The combination of the transitions from factories, other factories, the transitions of the warehouses and the transitions of new products into the manufacturing process we think pretty much hit a peak during the third quarter. I think you could go back to the historical trendline that we are on, and you could expect us to climb back onto that trendline. Just in general, but not in detail. Yes, all of the commodity prices have been difficult. Lead has been particularly difficult, so have any of the petroleum derivative plastic costs, as well as our transportation costs. We have seen some signs of the cost increases leveling out. But generally speaking, it was not an insignificant event. Against our long-term goal, we are probably in the mid single digits of our buildout. Okay. It is serious competition, but primarily from the installed base point of view, the awareness of this company, Retal, in the rack business is very very strong. They are very very well-established. They are not necessarily that well-established in the data center systems business, the data centers solutions business. And our functionality offering is substantially stronger than theirs, and that, therefore, gives us some distinct advantages. Their advantages certainly are their brand awareness and their market presence in that space compared to us. 8%, down about 4% year-over-year. And as we look at it, it was operational costs and price discounting that were slightly outweighing our improvements on the product outsourcing front. Yes, I would assume that they are components of the batteries which are in these products also. Government is actually a very small segment for us. It is in the low single digits. So we have not seen much of a change in that. I don't know if it is seasonally strong in Q4, the government spending. I don't have that answer. Normally we do see the peak of U.S. government spending, not global government spending and not local government spending, but U.S. federal government spending usually peaks in Q3 corresponding to the year-end of their fiscal year. No, well, it always does seasonally if that is what you mean. Do we expect it to pull back in Q4 relative to Q3? Yes. Historically it has always been lighter in Q4. Yes, I don't think we could necessarily comment and give you any visibility on that other than we pretty much for the year finished up where we thought we would give or take a bit on our government business. Yes, we are in the process of working on '06 budgets, and we do not have any forecasts to put before you now. The leadfree initiative is a serious initiative. We're making good progress there. We feel very comfortable at this stage that we're going to make the necessary compliance requirements in time. And regarding fuel cells, yes, we still are on track to do our first installation this year. No, we really could not do that at this stage because we are still in the process of experimenting to get the process clearly stable. Right. So if you need need further details on that, we will have to get them to you off-line. No, it will fluctuate around the rate of growth of the topline. But the fundamental issue is we still are in a very very target rich environment where the most important thing is to really gain segment share while we have this capability that is so thoroughly differentiated from the competition, and that is the purpose of accelerating investments when the opportunity is there to really drive the topline harder. We're not far away from being able to consistently show some leverage, but I certainly could not promise it to you in the next couple of quarters. Well, we're working hard on that, but in this particular case it was really about meeting customer requirements, and our systems and our processes certainly are getting enhanced to be able to give us better visibility. But from the point of view of what actually happened in this quarter, we really did not see it until -- we knew we committed the organization to meeting the customer requirements, and we were not sure what there was going to mean in terms of expenses. I'm not sure that as CEO I would say that there's anything I would sit back saying that I'm really satisfied with, because as you know we look around the business and we can see areas of improvement that we really need to mobilize on. But we certainly felt that we underperformed our potential on our entitlement on the earnings line. No, but I can tell you if we can finish up the '06 planning, there is a possibility we could share something like that with you. What we're not targeting right now is any specific return on investment metric because we are a firm believer that we've got to really go for share, really drive up the awareness of ISX in the marketplace, really drive up the deployments and then be able to really maximize the long-term return to shareholders. As we have talked on earlier calls, we are still in the 2 or 3 or 4% penetration into this new growth opportunity for APC. And the net result is that we really need to get up around 10, 15% market penetration to really say with strong momentum if we hit, say, 10, 15, 20% margin penetration with strong momentum, we could then say we could begin to optimize for returns. Two 1 megawatt units. Okay. We really appreciate you participating in the call. We again are very very confident of our opportunity here in the marketplace. It is really a tremendously exciting opportunity for everybody at APC, and we do understand that we have got to improve our execution to be able to perform better for shareholders. So once again we thank you for your support and looked forward to talking with you next quarter."
5," Well, relative to the current situation with the Small Systems, we are still finding that at times, due to customer requirements, and due to constraints in the supply chain, we do have to incur extra logistics costs, and part of the issues are addressable as improvement in our own efficiency, part of them are what we consider basically one time events. Sure, we are will already seeing from the early steps that we are taking that we were able to turn the momentum around a bit, and that it's the type of thing that will take probably 2 to 3 quarters on that order for us to really see the moments up show up on the P&L. We don't do forecasts, but I can tell you that so far in the March quarter, we are very gratified with the demand that we're seeing. Again, we don't give you the guidance or the forecast, but we can tell you that we are one month into the quarter, and the current demand trend is favorable. It's too early to try to optimize the OpEx in this new space. Again, let me set the context, it's a multi billion dollar opportunities, and what really matters is to introduce the customer through an education process to a new way to do data centers, once we do that, and do an effective job, the decision becomes quite a sticky decision, because at an architectural decision, and the follow on business has very low selling expenses with it. But the initial education process is a heavy lifting process. Like I said earlier, I think it's going to be about a two quarter to three quarter effort before we see it on its P&L. It's very tough to forecast, we are already seeing positive momentum, but in terms of really moving the needle, it's very hard to forecast. As Rich mentioned, when you do transfers, you still have a, until you finish the transfer process, you still have your manufacturing overhead and your existing locations which is a substantial expense. In addition, you have the start-up in efficiencies of both product lines and in some cases new factories. I think the trend that we talked about that has been a change compared to say, over the last four or five years, has been the lack of ability to continue to take our costs down due to commodity prices. If you could forecast commodity prices, I could give you an answer. Like we said early in the call, we don't give guidance and don't make forecasts. Like we said -- We don't give guidance. Sure, on the qualitative basis, it went pretty well, we were able to increase our coverage of certain market segments and particularly some of the direct accounts that we've been working closely with. And yet, we industrial a long way to go to even get above about the 20% level in the range of 20 to 30% level coverage of the large accounts that we like to cover. Well, as we've stated many times, the market is re competitive, however, in various cases, we have made adjustments to price although I don't believe we've done any that I can recall in the last year or so in the Small Systems space, but the, the margins themselves are also again being impacted by the transitions and the start-up of the new production lines that were incurring to move the Small Systems, some of the Small Systems product lines to lower cost manufacturing sites No, we did, but I don't know that, that we publicized the number, but it was in the single digit percent. I'd say give or take a little bit, yes. Nothing abnormal that I'm aware of. I don't have that data. We could probably dig it up. Sure, we looked very carefully at that acquisition as it came on the market, and from our viewpoint, it was not going to help us very much in the direction we are headed in. It is a legacy rack supplier that competes with a model that's very, very different than our approach to the rack business. Although it's incremental business for Lee berth, from our perspective, it is not that strategic in nature to really own that kind of a business. No, they are already trying to do that. So are a bunch of other competitors. That's already been underway for a number of months or years. So far, it's been difficult to judge in terms of the success in the marketplace as we do our own competitive analysis, they are a good 2 or 3 years behind where we are. Well, I'll give you a couple of equal qualitative comments. As we've grown the business, we've made those investments in building our service organization and in fact, at one stage, towards the, I think it was towards the middle of '04, ranging into early '05, we really were pretty lucky to be able to upgrade our service capability because in terms of the 3 phase business, with the vendor that really got the growing momentum in the markets place -- So we found that it was easier to recruit some of the top players in the services area that had experience because they, they really appreciated the new program to the marketplace. It is included. As our --"
6," Well, I mean Jamie we continue to work the pipeline aggressively. We do have -- you know, with he do have some known vacates so obviously we -- you know, we are adding those known move-outs to our -- existing vacancy, but the tenants that we still don't have a good enough read on, you know, we are still trying to get those tenants to renew. You know, they're kind of depicted on our lease expiration chart in the supplemental as well. But we do have 25 tenants that we know are vacating that comprise approximately 730,000 square feet and that's really kind of why we -- you know, we are expecting occupancy levels to remain relatively flat until the latter part of the year when the pipeline conversion on new deals kicks in. Certainly we look at the pipeline, Jordan. There is a number of larger tenants in there that if they would select the Brandywine property could have a positive impact on what we've witnessed going through the last reforecasts with the leasing teams. But conversely there is a lot of other activity there that has yet to be committed. So we have -- we have 64% done, that means the balance is not done yet. So, in that there's an implicit risk that tenants change their mind, corporate officers make decisions to relocate to other or consolidate. So I think as we -- every quarter when we go through that detailed reforecast, our leasing teams, in counsel with the folks here at the corporate office, make our best educated guess on what we think we can actually deliver, not just by the end of the year but certainly during the interim quarter. So that's a big revenue impact for us as well. And that forecast was just completed a week and a half ago and reflects our best estimate of what we are confident we can deliver during 2012. Sure. It was 3.4 million square feet in total, 2.9 million square feet of new deals, 0.5 million square feet of renewal deals and within that pipeline 762,000 square feet in active lease negotiation. And, John, in terms of the expirations I mean they're occurring pretty much ratably over the first three quarters of 2012. And of the 730,000 square feet, we've already backfilled with new tenancy so there's still a -- they're a negative impact to the retention calculation but from an occupancy perspective we have successfully backfilled about 100,000 square feet of that list. Oh, I'm sorry. You did say Page 37. Very little to almost no exposure to that list until you get down to Intel. They've got a January 2013 expiration down in our Austin portfolio. About half of it was known and about half of it is still speculative based on the assessment of today's pipeline. Michael, also I guess what we're hearing from a number of those particularly the larger corporations I mean there clearly remains a very -- a very keen focus on efficiencies. Average occupancy costs per employee, what the space utilization is per employee, and some of the corporations we're talking to at one end of the extreme are down to open floor plans, designing 6 by 6 cubes, getting town to 100 square feet per employee, others are still closer to 200 square feet per employee. It kind of depends on the industry. But look, certainly, open architecture in the new office age is becoming more the norm than the exception. So items like column spacing, floor to ceiling heights, window lines are all an increasing part of how tenants evaluate new locations. Well, they're not specifically identified. They are layered in as part of -- we have $200 million of properties -- actually little bit north of that -- on the market for sale today. Some of those properties are in advanced discussions and would count towards that $80 million. I think when we were saying we haven't identified yet, we haven't announced any specific transactions yet that we can credit to that 80, but we're well ahead of the curve by having a number of things in the marketplace today that are being actively marketed and reviewed by potential buyers. Well I mean certainly as we look at the portfolio we've announced that our plan is to -- is to exit the California marketplace. There's about 1 million square feet there. We've also made progress over the last two years in particular relative to reducing the overall exposure of the Company to the New Jersey and Delaware markets to right now a little bit less than 12% and the game plans is to continue that program over the next couple of years. And then we look at the Pennsylvania suburbs, metro DC and Richmond Virginia there is clearly -- there's clearly properties in those asset pools that we have identified as being non-core that we think as those properties stabilize and as the investment market recovers that we would move those into the marketplace for sale. So I guess Michael when you look at the portfolio there's really -- almost every one of those markets that we have identified has some element of assets that we would be targeting for disposition over the next several years. Just as reflective of the -- as what Tom outlined on the Allstate joint venture, there we clearly have an announced plan to increase our revenue contribution from metro DC, but certainly as part of that there were a number of assets that we identified as potential sale or JV properties that are already in the existing portfolio. At least in that range, correct. Well we've got a 60,000 square foot tenancy at One Logan that we know they are going to vacate their space. And then as we talked about a few ago on Three Logan, some of the tenant that we inherited when we bought the building that have that July 31, 2012 lease expiration -- some of those are also forecasted to roll out. And those are the tenants that we're currently negotiating with to try and workout some of a blend and extend whether on a short-term or on a long-term basis. Their conversion was pursuant to the terms of the original deal where they had the ability to convert from units to shares. You may recall that they were initially set up as units, simply because we wanted to create a structure whereby we didn't pay dividends on that equity issuance for a year following closing. So once they started to receive the dividends they were completely indifferent to whether they held shares or units. Yes. Jamie, I think, as I mentioned earlier, we've got $9 million of spec revenue left to achieve. That's going to require us to do just a little bit north of 1.5 million square feet. The pipeline is strong -- it's 3.4 million square feet in total. Two and a half million square feet of that are new prospects, and 900,000 of renewal prospects. And we feel confident that with the pipeline that we have, the conversion rates that we've demonstrated -- last year, our conversion was 40%. It was 31% for the first quarter. But we've got several markets that continue to kind of outperform that 40% company average. Yes, I mean, that would be correct. It's a function of the additional $1 million we added to the leasing plan, the somewhat better expense profile in the first quarter; and then just a lot of little stuff, but not big enough yet to move us outside the range we outlined earlier. The assets we're looking at are kind of in the -- if we're looking in the district in kind of those target markets we're looking at, we're seeing them in the 7% to 8% range, and inside the district below that. There would have to be a story to tell on those type of cap rates in terms of IRR, because we're pretty much IRR-driven. So the cap rate doesn't necessarily tell the whole story. But that's kind of where the cap rates we're seeing are now in that market. That's one -- and if you look at Austin, which is another market we're leased, there's enough trades that you can get an idea that it's pretty much in the"
7," Yes, they're pretty much across the board. Most of our adds are going to be onshore U.S. and offshore U.S. but let me have Mark answer it in more detail. Gosh, we've experimented with 20 acre spacing. Mark do you want to have any more than that? And it's been successful in some areas. No. Absolutely not. Do you want to amplify the answer. Well, as a matter of course, Brad, we -- we trim non-core low margin properties, just as we go along, as we've done this year. We did last year and we did the year before. And I will remind you in the last two years we've sold, what over 45,000 barrels a day of heavy oil in Guatemala and Canada, which for low margin -- real low margin properties. We've sold stuff in south Texas. We've sold stuff in Louisiana that didn't -- you know in Arkansas -- excuse me in eastern Oklahoma that just didn't fit our fiscal. If we can't grow it, we want to sell it. Do we contemplate any major sales like selling Algeria or selling west Texas or something? No. Well, Venezuela is a very profitable, believe it or not, operation. And we're pleased with that. In fact, in our ongoing review of where we need to be focusing foreign exploration, Venezuela may well come up on the radar screen. Thanks. Okay. Well, I don't think we've said we're finished paying down debt for the time being. We are going to pour our capital budget to be less than cash flow next year. We don't know what either is going to be right now. And we'll use that free cash in one of the five ways I mentioned, acquisitions, more drilling, pay down debt, buy stock, or increase dividends. We haven't made that decision yet. We'd like to make it when we have the money in our pocket. Thank you. That's our business! Good morning. You bet. Thank you. We'll take one more question. Well, this is Bob Allison. I will take this question. We're probably pretty close to making a deal. I mean, within the next year or so. We've got people bidding on a Marco Polo-type structure that would be a hub to develop fields on a spoke-like arrangement. The 500 BCF is 500 BCF total to make the hub worth while. And the point is that it is very dry gas, everything that's been found so far. So your -- the amount of equipment and the amount of flow lines and so forth you have to have is a lot less than if you have oil-rich gas and dry gas. So that's one of the things that's been encouraging. But, you know, we've just barely scratched the surface. We have two discoveries out of the three wells. We're drilling a fourth well. We'll be drilling more wells there this winter as will the rest of industry and I think you are going to find that this is going to be a significant producing area, and very economic. Produced in the hub-and-spoke concept and we're very high on it, obviously. Did I answer your question. Well, as I said earlier, I'm not going to comment on that now. Clearly, you know, I'm 64 years old, I'm not going to work until I'm age 70 so they need to find somebody to replace this old body. But beyond that I'm not going to talk about timing or speculate on any other aspect of it. No comment. Thanks to all of you."
8," Well, good morning everyone and welcome to our 2009 Annual Stockholders meeting. I'd like to begin the meeting by introducing the corporate officers who are with us today. And let me begin by introducing our newest member to the senior executive team, David Zinsner. David is our new Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. We very much welcome you to the very important role that you're playing throughout all this turmoil. Also here today is Sam Fuller, who is our Vice President of Research and Development. Bill Matson, Human Resource Vice President. Robbie McAdam, Vice President of our Analog business. Vincent Roche, the Vice President of our Worldwide sales. Margaret Seif, our Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary of the Company. Jerry McGuire, Vice President of our DSP business. And finally, Jerry, who needs no introduction, our President and CEO. And I'd also like to introduce our Directors who are with us today. And I begin by welcoming Neil Novich, former Chairman and CEO of Ryerson Inc., to his first annual meeting here at Analog. Neil is standing for reelection today after having been appointed by the Board as a Director back in May of 2008. Yves-Andre Istel, who is the Senior Advisor for Rothschild, who is also standing for reelection here today. And Jim Champy, who is the Vice President and Chairman of Perot Systems. And Jim will also be standing for reelection here today. John Doyle, retired Executive Vice President at Hewlett-Packard, one of our old timers. And John Hodgson, retired Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer of DuPont. Grant Saviers, retired Chairman and CEO of Adaptec. Paul Severino, who is the founder of Wellfleet Communications and former Chairman of Bay Networks. Kenton Sicchitano, retired Global Managing Partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers. And Ken is also standing for reelection here today. And again, our President, CEO, and Director of Analog Devices, Jerry. Next I'd like to introduce Analog's independent auditors, Ernst & Young. We are asking the shareholders today to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young as our auditors for 2009. And representing E&Y here today is Sean Lynch, Sean. And our outside counsel, finally. I'd like to introduce Wilmer Hale, being represented by Mark Boyden. So for looking back on 2008, Jerry, our management team and all the employees turned in a very solid performance across the many aspects of our business. We take great pride and satisfaction in the results that were achieved last year, especially in comparison to our competitors, our direct competitors, and to the semiconductor industry overall. We did quite well. Jerry will comment a bit on that later. And now we're caught up in this whirlwind, which is by far the worst economic turmoil or downturn that I've witnessed and participated in in my 40 plus years here at Analog Devices. Now, the entire Analog Devices community has participated and is participating in resizing our expenses to fit the current level of business. One of the manifestations of that is here we are at our annual meeting, paying no rent as we have in the past, and serving home brewed doughnuts and coffee. So this is just some indication of the extremes to which we're going to deal with this situation we find ourselves in. As we look to the future and face a very unpredictable, and in many ways unprecedented future, there's both an opportunity and a requirement for Analog Devices to rethink our priorities and to improve every aspect of our business going forward. While at the same time, maintaining the kind of investments that will keep us in the forefront in the future in leadership and our business and growing it successful in the longer term. One of the indicators of the confidence that we have in Analog Devices and the opportunities that we have out there before us is the fact that we're continuing at a very high rate of investment in R&D, approaching 25% of sales. Analog Devices is very strong financially, with significant market share in most of its product lines and with very, very successful long-term relationships with many of its worldwide customers. So we're fortunate in that regard and being able to make the investments that we need to make despite these desperate times that we're living through to ensure the continued success of the Company in the long term. So Jerry is going to review in a few moments the steps that we have already taken and the steps that we are taking to cope with these unusual times and also to emerge on the other side of all this stronger as a company than we've ever been before, in our competitive capabilities and abilities to serve our customers around the world. So with that introduction, I'd like turn the podium over here to Marnie Seif who will conduct the formal part of our business, thank you."
9," Thank you, Mary Ann. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon to you all. It's a pleasure to participate in this year's conference, as Mary Ann said, for the first time. I'd like to begin by introducing the Anheuser-Busch executives with me here today. Randy Baker, our Vice President and CFO, you all know Randy; John Kelly, Vice President and Controller; Dave Peacock, our new Vice President of Marketing; and Evan Athanas, our new Vice President of Sales on my far left. And Dave Sauerhoff, our VP of Investor Relations, and you all know Dave.  In our presentation today, I will discuss the performance and strategies of our US and international beer businesses, along with a brief look at our other subsidiaries. Then our CFO, Randy Baker, will review our company's financial results, cash priorities and our long-term outlook. To begin, I'd like to take you back three weeks ago when an estimated 90 million television viewers tuned in to watch Super Bowl XLII, I think the most people that have ever watched a TV broadcast, I think except for the last episode of M*A*S*H, which I wasn't a big fan of myself, but you may have been. I'm proud to say that for the 10th straight year -- which is truly amazing and I'm very proud of our marketing teams -- our company topped the USA Today Ad Meter Poll, which took a lot of work by a lot of people and a lot of agencies. Our Super Bowl winning spot featured a dedicated Budweiser Dalmatian that becomes a personal trainer to a Clydesdale who is determined to join the world-famous Budweiser eight-horse hitch. In the true underdog Rocky style, they make it happen. Let's watch this spot. Thank you, Randy. The fewer the questions, the more beer. Yes, sir? Well, there is no discounting on the headline increases. We have seen some trading down to subpremiums. Of the 0.6% recent volume growth, I'll ask Randy or Evan to comment, because last time Randy spoke with you, we were down 1.5%. But we have seen subpremium brand strength, which I'll take that glass half full because of the economic situation that is out there, gasoline, etc. That is a good thing that we do have those products priced appropriately for the consumer. They can't afford a premium or above product. Do you know the specific number of the 0.6 that would have been subpremium versus premium, Randy? We will dig that out for you, Bill. It's a good question. Yes, sir. No, we are not going to sell a subpremium brand. The Natural family and the Busch family provide excellent downsize protection, as Bill just talked about. And the margins are relatively good for those products. As a matter of fact, we can build new capacity on Natural Light margins. Now, obviously, we don't like the mix hit of taking a $75 barrel of Budweiser down to $55 to $60 a barrel of Busch, but we would rather have the Bush  expect we'd see something from that creative by summer. Now, keep in mind, we are not going to call this year successful unless we obviously exceed our profit targets, exceed our volume and share targets on our core business that we talked about as our number one priority. But we can't get distorted by Bud Light Lime, which will be introduced in May, on the 5th of May, and that will be a big brand. We've got a relatively modest number in our financial plan for Bud Light Lime, but that's going to be a big deal and it's going to be fueled with $35 million in media, as I expressed to you before. So, we can't let that give us a false sense of security that underlying core business is good. So the answer to your question, we've been two months into it. We do think it will bring incremental business. We are very strong with that core consumer, that sport consumer, that Dale Earnhardt Jr. NASCAR fan. We got hammered for losing Dale Jr.; it may have been kind of a blessing in disguise. And we went to Kasey Kahne. It's a different type of image for the brand and more towards that different type of consumer that I was explaining versus the loyalist or the traditional core American -- Central American consumer. We do very well in rural America, we do less well in the more urban marketplaces. And that is why we've broadened our portfolio, to do better in those urban marketplaces and to give our distributors the opportunity to compete in the urban marketplaces like New York or Boston or even Chicago. Yes, sir. Why did we give out razors? I'm worried about you. Okay -- well, shave. I'll shave my head if I could make this year's volume target. Tony Stewart didn't cut his hair. Go ahead. Absolutely. First of all, let me start by saying you all know this -- that the US is by far the most profitable beer market in the world. We're 5.5, maybe 5.7 billion just at the producer level. Brazil passed Mexico, as you all know, as well. And over the last five years, we've put a lot of money into share repurchase. And as you also know, SAB and InBev did a lot of global consolidation and got a lot of the global footprint presence in emerging markets, which has been reflected in their stock price and their performance over time. Now lately, they've softened up a bit for commodity cost pressures and some other reasons. We, obviously as a new leadership team came in, took a very good look at our Company, understood the businesses that we were in and evaluated the Packaging business, evaluated the Entertainment business, knew that we had to get our core beer business, which was the cash cow that generates the $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion in cash that Randy was talking about, up and running and running strong. Now, we also knew we had a weak dollar. We also knew that some of these other opportunities globally were out of range right now unless you went out to pick up a bunch of smaller opportunities. So, when I first came into the job last December, our first big planning meeting we had a bunch of investment bankers come in and talk to us. And the summary coming out of that was you guys have got to get back to blocking and tackling in the base business and sharpen your execution and your focus and program performance, broaden your portfolio, do everything that we kind of talked about doing to get the base business up and running and get it healthy. And you are going to see that this year. You're going to see much more of our earnings coming from operating companies that we control; much less coming, unfortunately, from our partner in Mexico that we don't control. But that is equity income and the only cash we get benefit, as you know, is from the dividend payment that they choose to pay. So, operating businesses will accelerate. We are going to be much more aggressive, as Randy and I said, on the cost front. We are going to exceed that 400 In terms of Modelo, Gerard, again we have had some very positive discussions. We see a great future that we could build together. They have built an amazing brand, an amazing business. We respect them a lot and again, we think together we can do more and that is what we will pursue with them in discussions. So far, discussions have been very positive and we see no grounds for impeding our transaction."
10," Buying back Aon stock, I don't think that's, no we're not, we have disclosed everything. And special charges. Sure, and I'd like Mike, who normally handles the pricing discussion to do that but as you know, and I'm sure you have been following, I know you follow the other brokers, because I read what you write, there are no brokers that are having proportional increases to what carriers are reporting in terms of rate change, go ahead Mike. Yeah, as people, I think, know we've building our claims management business through our acquisition over a number of years, and the name of the company is Cambridge, we believe, that is one of the leading providers of claims management, investment management and claims service both to the commercial and the industrial world, and of course, we are now expanding that to others, and in the first quarter of 2000 it was about 4.5% of insurance service revenues, and in 2001 it's about 7%. Currency was virtually neutral as we previously indicated we do not hedge because of our assessment of the cost versus the benefit, the revenue side of it. We just are not able to, at this point efficiently, manage that and obviously most of our expenses are in local currencies as well, but we do hedge our profit and in the quarter it had no effect on us on a pretax income. Good Morning. Well, that, there is a couple of different factors. One is with the number you are looking at is not adjusted for the foreign currency, which is one factor. Second, there have been decline in rates in certain parts of the world, particularly in the US, and as we previously indicated we continue to take companies that we have acquired mostly outside the US, and then consolidating them as best we can to manage the capital structures in those countries and if we do some of our investments, I know that doesn't speak to the reinvestment income, and brokerage, but we have been able to take some of the capital out and then obviously as Mike and Pat have indicated, in some cases, where pricing and the way clients are paying for things that do impact, but there is no structural change. It's a combination of all of those factors. Not offhand, we can get it to you Larry. So, it's obviously the number different of countries. In the aggregate. Dan, again, just to clarify what we do, we mostly impact the major country currencies that have our larger operations, and what we do is, take the income translations from those countries and hedge up against it. We do not, in any fashion, go through any process of trying to anticipate anything other than our income exposure, so there is no speculative cycle. We really do nothing more than try to protect our income translation that comes in on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And in the quarter for our insurance services, operations were somewhat under $5 million and we do this, each and every quarter throughout the year. Yes. That's two questions that are a bit different; so let me answer the first one. Obviously, transition costs are a moving target, Mark, and this has to do with attrition rates, it has to do with the timing of getting certain things established, for example, the service centers. There will be additional, what we would call, transition costs past the second quarter as we're establishing the service centers. They are not all going to be, I think we've mentioned this, I know we've mentioned this, they'll not all be in place fully operative, some of them basically till yearend, and so they are going to be transition costs that will continue and the statements that we've made is that we are comfortable that beginning in the fourth quarter of the combination of everything we've done will give us a fourth quarter run rate, it is $150 million range. So I hope that answers that. In terms of the businesses that no longer meet the hurdle rates, that revenue on an annual basis, is about $50 million. Well, it is the net number we're talking about, so I think the answer is that in the charge-off we've got the transition costs and in the savings it's a net number so that what we're saying is on a net basis, there is the run rate up to 150. I think what you are really trying to get at, maybe I can answer it this way, is that as we move into 2002, a combination of what we've taken out and getting rid of the transition costs, that's the number we say we are comfortable within that range, is running at a $150 million to run through 2002. And that's why we give a range. Oh, if you look at the number that we gave you, the 2:1 and then 3:1, we said that it's a slowdown in new business, I think that pretty well answers the question, but retention rates are a little bit above what they were, but nothing dramatic. Excuse me, excuse me, when I say retention rate, what I mean by that, just to clarify for everybody, that is the ratio of loss business is up, but modestly. John, we wouldn't say that if we didn't feel that. We don't give out individual margins but that's a rapidly growing business with huge investments and new people and technology, and so they are at an inventory margin rate but they're growing well and will continue to grow well, the margins will improve and we're just very excited about how that business is working in to the overall Aon, and the overall one Aon strategy. Absolutely, absolutely we're making money. Right. Well, what I did say was that there was the slow down in the first quarter and we expect that to recover this year. To your earlier point 3.4 we said last year was really outstanding. We said in the past that if you can be in the high 2:1, that's very good, I mean 2:7, 2:8. We've always been an organization that has a high production capability. If you look at our business compared to other people you follow, I think you'd agree with that. The organization in the first quarter was very much involved in the implementation and still some planning, but mostly implementation of the transformation and frankly that caused a lot of people to be focusing in the implementation of the plans, the retention of clients, the communication with clients, the communication with Aon colleagues, the explanation of everything, and we anticipated that there will be a slowdown in new business as a result of those activities, and there was. We do believe that this is a very powerful sales organization that is going to return to its ability to generate very strong new growth, and as a matter of fact as I indicated in my earlier comments, this transformation is for a very, very long term, changing the way we do business, and based on everything that we believe and that we're seeing in terms of the implementation. This transformation plan will generate very strong rates of new growth, and that has to be through increasing rate periods, level rate periods, the declining rate periods, and that's what we're positioning the company for. It's also designedaround the clients to provide more of Aon and much better value added, although it is very good value added now and improved value added and improved service, and therefore we think that over the long term that will give us a better retention of our clients. So all of this is designed to improve what we've had and frankly we've had on a comparative basis to peer group, quite good ratios, so as we said earlier, we said in November, we said earlier in the year that we expected the wind at our back on these issues beginning in the second half of the year. We have no reason to change that belief and we're very pleased and quite optimistic about the impact of transformation and what we've been talking about here is the US retail, but if you go back to what I said about international retail that was 2.8:1, quite strong. The other businesses are having very good growth, so that's why we are comfortable. I got a question earlier whether the individual businesses are in the aggregate for the double-digit rates of growth and clearly it's in the aggregate, but we're very enthusiastic about all of what's going on. Thank-you. I want to thank you all for being with us and thank you for your interest in our company. Goodbye."
